SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable;

      my $mech = WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable->new();
         $mech->get('http://search.cpan.org/');
         $mech->submit_form(
            form_name => 'f',
            fields    => {

         );

      my $results = $mech->scrape( '/html/body/h2/a', 'results[]', 
                                   { title => 'TEXT, url => '@href' }

DESCRIPTION
    "WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Web::Scraper" gives you the scraping power of
    Web::Scraper in WWW::Mechanize, hence the name ...

  METHODS
   scrape
    "scrape" is the only new method that can be called (as of yet) and
    accepts process information as described in Web::Scraper. Note that the
    function *process* can (and should) be omitted. The scraper will use the
    current WWW::Mechanize content, so make sure to "browse" to the right
    page before calling the scrape function.

SEE ALSO
    WWW::Mechanize

    Web::Scraper

BUGS
    "Bugs?" Most likely you want to pester either Andy (if WWW::Mechanize is
    broken), Joe (if WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable isn't working as expected) or
    Tatsuhiko (the Web::Scraper mastermind).

    If these three people can't help, it then might be possible that this
    module is to blame (ok, I admit it, this module probably *is* to blame
    to begin with). Please be so kind to report it to
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Create.html?Queue=WWW-Mechanize-Plugin-Web-Sc
    raper>.
